# ShopEasy Marketing Analytics

## Project Overview
ShopEasy, an online retail business, is experiencing reduced customer engagement and conversion rates despite investing in new marketing campaigns. This project analyzes customer feedback and marketing performance to identify areas for improvement and propose actionable insights.

## Business Problem
- **Reduced Customer Engagement**: Declining interaction with marketing content (views, clicks, likes, comments).
- **Decreased Conversion Rates**: Fewer website visitors are making purchases.
- **High Marketing Expenses**: Increased spending on campaigns without proportional returns.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understanding customer opinions to improve satisfaction and conversions.

## Key Metrics (KPIs)
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.
- **Customer Engagement Rate**: Interaction levels with marketing content.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Average spending per transaction.
- **Customer Feedback Score**: Average rating from customer reviews.

## Insights & Findings
- **Conversion Trends**:
  - Conversion rates varied throughout the year, peaking at **18.5% in January** (driven by Ski Boots) and dropping to **4.3% in May**.
  - Seasonal trends suggest opportunities for targeted promotions in lower-performing months.
- **Customer Engagement**:
  - Views peaked in February and July but declined in the second half of the year.
  - Blog content drove the highest engagement, while video and social media content had steady but lower performance.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**:
  - Majority of reviews (275) were positive, but **negative sentiment was found in 82 reviews**.
  - Products with ratings below **3.5** need focused improvements to enhance customer satisfaction.
